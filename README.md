Task 7 : Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

### 1.Open your browser’s extension/add-ons manager.
*Every modern browser has a section to manage extensions or add-ons. <br> 
for Chorme / Firefox -> Click menu (⋮) -> Extensions  ->  Manage Extensions*

### 2.Review all installed extensions carefully.
*Example - a) Grammarly – a writing assistant. <br>
           b) Adblock Plus – ad-blocking tool.  <br>
           c) Free PDF Converter – unknown publisher.  <br>
           d) Coupon Finder 2023 – installed automatically with free software*

### 3.Check permissions and reviews for each extension.
*Example - Adblock Plus might request access to “Read and change data on all websites”  -> this is used to block ads. <br>
*Analysis - Malicious extensions often disguise themselves as helpful tools*

### 4.Identify any unused or suspicious extensions.
 *Example: Installed “Dark Mode for Facebook” few years ago but never use it → most likely dead weight* <br>
 *Analysis - Unused extensions can be exploited if the developer updates the same with malware codes*

### 5.Remove suspicious or unnecessary extensions.
*Example - Keep Grammerly, Remove PDF Converter, and Coupon Finder*
*Extensions -> toggle off or click Remove.*

### 6.Restart browser and check for performance improvements.
*Example:
Before removal -> Chrome took 15 seconds to start and used 2 GB RAM. <br>
After removal -> Chrome opens in 5 seconds and uses only 1.2 GB RAM* <br>
*Analysis - Extensions run processes in the background. Removing unsued ones often improves speed &  reduces memory usage.*

### 7.Research how malicious extensions can harm users.
*Malicious extensions are a serious cybersecurity risk.
**Examples of harm:**
    a) Data theft: Some extensions can log keystrokes or steal passwords.
    b) Crypto mining: Extensions can secretly use your CPU/GPU to mine cryptocurrency.
    c) Ad injection: They replace ads on websites with their own, generating revenue for hackers.
    d) Tracking: They can monitor every website you visit and sell the data.
**Case study:**
In 2020, Google removed 106 Chrome extensions that were secretly stealing user data and redirecting traffic to phishing sites.

### 8.Document steps taken and extensions removed.
*Keep a small log for accountability, especially if this is for work or cyber security training.*  <br>
**Example documentation:**
*Steps Taken:  <br>
   1.	Opened Chrome extensions manager.  <br>
   2.	Reviewed 6 installed extensions.   <br>
   3.	Checked permissions and reviews.   <br>
   4.	Identified 2 suspicious extensions (Free PDF Converter, Coupon Finder 2023).  <br>
   5.	Removed both suspicious extensions.   <br>
   6.	Restarted Chrome and observed faster load time.   <br>
   7.	Researched malicious extension risks (data theft, crypto mining, ad injection).   <br>
Extensions Kept: Grammarly, Adblock Plus.   <br>
Extensions Removed: Free PDF Converter, Coupon Finder 2023.*



## INTERVIEW QUESTIONS ##

1.How can browser extensions pose security risks?  <br>
*A. They can inject malicious code, track browsing activity, or exfiltrate sensitive data if compromised or poorly designed.*  <br>

2.What permissions should raise suspicion? <br>
*A. Permissions like “Read and change all your data on all websites” or “Access browsing history” without clear purpose should be treated cautiously.*  <br>

3.How to safely install browser extensions?  <br>
*A. Only to install from official stores, verify publisher reputation, and check reviews, download counts, and requested permissions.*  <br>

4.What is extension sandboxing?  <br>
*A. It is a security mechanism that isolates extensions from the browser core, limiting their ability to harm the system or other applications.*  <br>

5.Can extensions steal passwords?  <br>
*A. Yes, malicious or compromised extensions with access to page content can capture login credentials and form data.*  <br>

6.How to update extensions securely?   <br>
*A. Enable automatic updates through the official browser store and avoid downloading extension files from third-party websites.*  <br>

7.Difference between extensions and plugins?  <br>
*A. Extensions enhance browser functionality within the browser itself, while plugins integrate external software (e.g., Flash, Java) to handle specific content.*  <br>

8.How to report malicious extensions? <br>
*A. Report directly through the browser’s web store (e.g., Chrome Web Store → Report Abuse) or to the browser vendor’s security team.*
